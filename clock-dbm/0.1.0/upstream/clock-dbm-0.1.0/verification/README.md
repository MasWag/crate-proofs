# Verification

The production `clock-dbm` crate is verified with **Creusot v0.14.0**.
[`PROOF_STATUS.md`](PROOF_STATUS.md) states the machine-checked properties,
the trusted base, the pinned toolchain and the recorded evidence. This page
covers the layout of this directory and practical notes for running the proofs.

- `scripts/install-creusot.sh`: installs the pinned Creusot, Why3, why3find and
  solver environment in an isolated prefix.
- `scripts/env.sh`: selects that environment and the pinned nightly Rust.
- `scripts/prove-crate.sh`: the proof gate for the crate at the repository root.
- `scripts/check-proofs.sh`, `scripts/check-proofs.py`: independently check
  that every generated goal has a prover certificate.
- `scripts/negative-control-crate.sh`: injects deliberate defects into scratch
  copies and requires the verifier to reject each one.
- `results/`: recorded proof-gate logs.

## Quick start

Requirements: `git`, `rustup`, `opam` (≥ 2.1), `curl`, `python3`, a C toolchain, and gmp/zlib/pkg-config/autoconf.

```sh
verification/scripts/install-creusot.sh      # install the pinned toolchain
verification/scripts/prove-crate.sh --proof-only  # prove all goals and check erasure
verification/scripts/prove-crate.sh              # full gate, including 21 negative controls
```

`--proof-only` reuses the prover cache `.why3find` (see [Proof cache](#proof-cache));
run `rm -rf .why3find` first, or the full gate, to call every prover afresh.

The steps of the gate are listed in
[`PROOF_STATUS.md`](PROOF_STATUS.md#reproducing-the-verification). The log goes
to `results/crate-<os>-<arch>.log` by default; set `PROVE_LOG` to write it
elsewhere.

To look at a single function, run `cargo creusot <module>/<function>` with the
pinned environment (`. verification/scripts/env.sh && use_pinned_rust`). Add
`--why3session` and inspect `verif/**/why3session.xml` to find an unproved
sub-goal.

## Proof cache

why3find keeps the result of each prover call in `.why3find` at the
repository root, keyed by a checksum of the proof task and a digest of the
prover configuration (name, version, command, driver and options); a change
of Why3 discards the whole cache. Creusot's Why3 configuration names the
solvers by command without a version, so the cache does not tell solver
binaries apart: delete `.why3find` after installing different solvers (CI
keys its cache on the installer script for this reason). A result is reused
only for an identical task, prover and compatible time limit, so after a
source change only the goals whose tasks changed reach a prover again. The verdicts of the calibration
probes are cached too, so a warm cache also keeps the time scaling of the
run that filled it.

The **full gate** deletes `.why3find`, so every goal is proved by a fresh
prover call. **`--proof-only` keeps it**, but still deletes `target/creusot`
and `verif`: translation and the erasure check rerun (pitfall 1), and every
`proof.json` is regenerated for the current Coma files. The log records
how many cached results were present.

`scripts/check-proofs.sh` then checks that every Coma file has a
`proof.json` whose goals are all closed by a named prover. It does not
rerun any prover, and it cannot tell a cached verdict from a fresh one, so
a proof-only pass relies on the cache's integrity as well as on the
provers. Only the full gate is evidence of fresh SMT results.

## GitHub Actions

The [Creusot workflow](../.github/workflows/creusot.yml) runs `--proof-only`
for PRs targeting `master` and pushes to `master`. This mode still builds
and tests the crate, translates it afresh, checks erasure, proves every
obligation, and checks the generated proof certificates. It omits the
21 negative controls, which are more expensive and can encounter solver
calibration instability, and it restores `.why3find` from the newest
Actions cache whose key matches the OS, architecture, Creusot version and
the hashes of `why3find.json`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `scripts/install-creusot.sh`
and `scripts/env.sh`. Rust sources are not part of the key; why3find decides
per task what to reuse. Only successful runs on `master` save the cache
(under a new key per run, as caches are immutable); PR runs may read it but
never write a cache that `master` or other PRs restore.

The **full gate** runs on version-tag pushes (`v*`) and on manual
`workflow_dispatch` runs with the `full_gate` input enabled (the default).
It neither restores nor saves the prover cache. Each run uploads its
verification log as an Actions artifact. A successful proof-only run is **not** evidence that the negative controls passed.

## Pitfalls

1. **Cached builds skip checks.** `cargo creusot` relies on cargo's fingerprinting, and changing only Creusot flags (`--erasure-check`, `--only`) does not trigger a rebuild. So a second invocation can "pass" without re-running the erasure check. The gate always deletes `target/creusot` first, and `verif`, so that no stale `proof.json` remains; only the prover cache `.why3find` is kept by `--proof-only`.
2. **Rust toolchain resolution.** If another `cargo` precedes rustup's proxies in `PATH`, `rust-toolchain.toml` is ignored and `creusot-rustc` fails to build or run. The scripts put the pinned toolchain's `bin/` first and set `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` / `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to its sysroot (`scripts/env.sh`).
3. **The erasure checker does not support builtin slice indexing** (`slice[i]`, "unsupported expression `Index`"). `Vec` indexing, which goes through `Index::index`, works.
4. **A public `ensures` that names a private field** is mistranslated when the function is called from another module (Coma `ERROR_UNBOUND_f0`; Why3 rejects the file, so it fails closed). State such contracts through `View`/`DeepModel` instead.
5. **`cargo creusot version` prints "bad CVC5 version"** for the pinned CVC5 1.4.1, because its parser expects the older `This is cvc5 version …` banner. This is cosmetic: Why3 is configured with CVC5 (`creusot_why3.conf`), and CVC5 discharges goals in the recorded run.
6. **`#[derive(PartialEq)]`** in verified code needs a `DeepModel`. A derived `DeepModel` on a type with private fields hits a visibility error, so a manual `impl DeepModel` with `#[logic(open(self))]` is used.
